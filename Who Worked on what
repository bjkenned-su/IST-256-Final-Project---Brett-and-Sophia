For this project, both sophia and i worked and contributed evenely. to start, sophia worked on finding an API from a car rental search
that would be useful in helping our code execute, she found this by searching open catalog API'S and registering for the key.
Next, both sophia and myself contributed evenly to writing the code, we both looked for ways to incoporate multiple lessons into
our work and were both able to get it to execute in the end. Third, we both helped make the demo video and the poster which we
were able to knock out relatively quick with the help of each other. We also both helped to making our own respository. Overall,
we enjoyed working with each other, we got along well and we believe we were very successfull and would work which each other
again in the future.
