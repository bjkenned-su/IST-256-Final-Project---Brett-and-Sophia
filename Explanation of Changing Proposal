In our original proposal, we said our plan was to use the Edmund's API to search for car vehcicles, but we had to stop this
idea because the edmund API is not accessible unless you are partnered through a buisness with them. So our next plan was 
to find another API with a very similar purpose. Instead of orginally finding new or used cars, this new API is going to help
users search for car rentals nearby.
